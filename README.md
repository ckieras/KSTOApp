##NOTE: THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ARE TO CREATE AN APP FROM SCRATCH
http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
Download node.js  https://nodejs.org/en/download/
**Node JS version must be 10.6.3

Close and reopen your command prompt!
Open your Command prompt and run this command:
npm install -g expo-cli

If this still doesn’t work search for your environment variables:
Open your PATH variables
Check that there is an environment variable that looks like this:
C:\Users\<yourusername>\AppData\Roaming\npm
If there isn’t click “New” and add this path to your environment variables

In your command line write:
expo init AwesomeProject
You should get a message like: Your project is ready
Then type in the command: cd <yourprojectname>
 
On your phone install the Expo App
Make sure that your laptop is connected to the same wifi as your phone
Open your project in an editor, I recommend using VSCODE
Once you make an edit and save it, the app will automatically update on your phone
